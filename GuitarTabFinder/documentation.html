    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h3>Process:</h3>
    <p>I started off searching for an API to use in order to search for guitar tabs, and found the Songsterr api (<a href = "https://www.songsterr.com/a/wa/api">https://www.songsterr.com/a/wa/api</a> and some sparse documentation. Since there wasn't much information in the documentation I then experimented a bit with using the API to search for different terms in order to get a better sense of how it worked. From there I started on the visual design and writing the basic javascript. My visual design is taken from Weezer's Blue Album which I picked as it's a popular reference within the guitar community. The button selectors in my controls section went through several iterations starting out as checkboxes to select which instrument to search for, which I then changed to selecting which tab type to search for because of issues with the api. Finally, I changed the button style from checkboxes to radio buttons at the suggestion of Professors Wheeland and Chin during the feedback party. The final touch was adding in and instructions page and local storage functions to save the users last search terms.</p>
    <h3>Sources:</h3>
    <p>My instructions pages uses screenshots taken from Songsterr's tabs for <a href= "https://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/metallica-master-of-puppets-tab-s455118">Master of Puppets</a> and <a href = "https://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/weezer-butterfly-tab-s22838">Butterfly.</a></p>
    <h3>Special Efforts:</h3>
    <p>I think the most interesting feature is how the formating of the results changes based on whether you search for only tabs or chords or both.</p>
    <h3>Requirements:</h3>
    <p>My website has 4 controls, 2 search bars, a set of radio buttons, and a drop down menu. Both search boxes save their contents to local storage when the search button is pressed.</p>
    <h3>Grade:</h3>
    <p>I would give myself a B+ on this assignment. I think my project's strong points are that I found a unique API, incorporated several different types of controls, and how I utilized those controls in my javascript. On the other hand I think my project is somewhat held back by the visual design of the control panel and several core javascript methods being very similar to the Gif Finder homework.</p>
